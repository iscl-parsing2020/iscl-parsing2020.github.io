## Introduction

This is the web page of the course
*Parsing, winter semester 2020-2021*
taught at the
[Department of Computational Linguistics](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ascl.html),
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).


This course provides an introduction to parsing,
including both an introduction to the thoery of parsing,
and as it is applied to parsing natural languages.
We cover both constituency (mainly context-free) parsing,
and dependency parsing.

### Practical information

| **Lectures**      | Monday        08:00-10:30, room 0.02 |
|                   | Thursday      08:00-10:30, room 0.02 |
| **First Lecture** | November 9 |
| **Lecturer**      | Çağrı Çöltekin [\<ccoltekin@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de\>](mailto:ccoltekin@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de) |
| **Tutors**        | TBA |


### Goals

The objectives of the course include:

  * Learning basic theory behind phrase-structure grammars
    and their relation to (the theory of) computation and automata.
  * Understand the concepts behind 
    - Top-down/bottom-up parsing
    - Chart parsing and deterministic parsing
    - Probabilistic parsing
    - Dependency grammars and dependency parsing

The focus of the course is understanding the theory of parsing
(and its use in parsing natural languages).
Although we do not focus on practical programming exercises,
you should be able to ready to implement a variety of parsing algorithms
after finishing this course.
